Project Description for GitHub:

Project Title: Hotel Management System - Network Design & Implementation
Overview:
This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive network for the Vic Modern Hotel with three floors, each hosting multiple departments. The network includes VLAN segmentation, OSPF routing, DHCP services, SSH remote access, Wi-Fi configuration, and port security to ensure a secure and efficient infrastructure.

Key Features:

Multi-Floor Network Design: Three routers (one per floor) connected via serial DCE cables.

VLAN Segmentation: Departments isolated into separate VLANs with unique IP subnets.

Dynamic IP Allocation: DHCP pools configured on routers for automatic IP assignment.

OSPF Routing: Dynamic route advertisement for seamless inter-VLAN communication.

Security Measures:

SSH access for secure remote management.

Port security (sticky MAC) on switches to restrict unauthorized access.

Wi-Fi Integration: Access points configured for guest and staff devices.

Testing & Validation: Ping tests, DHCP checks, and cross-department communication verified.

Technologies Used:

Cisco Packet Tracer (for simulation)

VLANs, OSPF, DHCP, SSH, Port Security

Repository Contents:

Detailed project report (DOCX).

Configuration screenshots and step-by-step CLI commands.

Network topology diagrams.

Why This Project?
Ideal for networking students or professionals looking to understand enterprise network design, VLANs, and security best practices in a real-world hospitality scenario.
